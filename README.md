Molecule Generator

The Molecule Generator is a web application that allows you to create, manipulate, and visualize molecular structures. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing atoms and molecules, changing atom colors, and generating SVG representations of molecules.

Features

C Backend: The Molecule Generator leverages a C backend to create and manipulate molecular structures efficiently.

Python Backend: Python is used as a backend for generating SVG representations of molecules and handling server-side functionality.

SQLite Database: The application utilizes SQLite to store atoms and molecules in a database, allowing for efficient retrieval and management of molecular data.

Server: Python is used to run the server that handles requests from the frontend and interacts with the database.

Frontend: The frontend of the Molecule Generator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user interface for displaying molecule SVGs, adding molecules to the database, and changing atom colors.

Usage

To use the Molecule Generator, follow these steps:

Install the necessary dependencies: Ensure that you have C, Python, SQLite, and the required Python libraries installed on your system.

Set up the database: Initialize the SQLite database by running the appropriate setup scripts.

Start the server: Run the server script to start the backend server.

Access the application: Open the Molecule Generator in a web browser to access the frontend user interface.

Interact with molecules: Use the provided functionality to create, manipulate, and visualize molecular structures. You can add molecules to the database, change atom colors, and view molecule SVG representations.
